#+title: Kanban Board

** Minimalist Kanban board experiment
**** Using HTMX, AlpineJS and PicoCSS for a frontend
**** Using Common Lisp with Eco for templating and jingle for a trivial webapp

** Running it
This system is basically a [[https://roswell.github.io/][Roswell]] script that compiles the "templates/" directory, load the sqlite3 database and starts a webapp.
Tried to keep it as minimal as possible, backend is less than 70 lines long and no html file is more than 25 lines.

To run it with roswell you can:
#+begin_src bash
./kanban-board.ros
#+end_src
and open http://localhost:5000

** TODOS
- Get [[https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/][SortableJS]] to gain drag and drop functions
- Editable cards
