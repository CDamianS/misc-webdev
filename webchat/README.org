#+title: Kanban Board

** Minimalist Kanban board experiment
**** Using HTMX, and PicoCSS for a frontend
**** Using Common Lisp with Eco for templating, websocket-driver for the real-time communication and jingle for a trivial webapp

Wanted to try out websockets in common lisp and also how they work on HTMX

** Running it
To run it with roswell you can:
#+begin_src bash
./web-chat.ros
#+end_src
and open http://localhost:5000
